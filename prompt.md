“I have successfully set up an Electron-based note-taking application using TypeScript and React. Electron and Vite are correctly integrated, and the app launches properly in both development and production modes. Notes are written and stored in Markdown. The app features a three-panel layout: a left navigation panel for browsing a directory of notes, a middle panel for writing notes, and a right panel for interacting with Ollama. Ollama will be used to answer questions, retrieve relevant notes using a local SQLite RAG database, and summarize Q&A interactions into coherent notes.

I am strictly using TypeScript with strong type safety. All components and functions must have explicit types, ensuring maintainability and reducing runtime errors.

Current Progress:
✅ Electron + Vite integration completed
✅ Markdown editing with react-simplemde-editor and live preview implemented

Next Steps:
1️⃣ File Navigation (Left Panel): Display and browse Markdown files
2️⃣ AI Chat Interface with Ollama (Right Panel): Implement an interactive chat assistant
3️⃣ SQLite Integration for RAG-based retrieval: Store and retrieve Markdown chunks efficiently

The goal remains to package everything into a single installer for easy distribution.”
