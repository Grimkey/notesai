“I have successfully set up an Electron-based note-taking application using TypeScript and React. Electron and Vite are correctly integrated, and the app launches properly in both development and production modes. Notes are written and stored in Markdown. The app features a three-panel layout: a left navigation panel for browsing a directory of notes, a middle panel for writing notes, and a right panel for interacting with Ollama. Ollama will be used to answer questions, retrieve relevant notes using a local SQLite RAG database, and summarize Q&A interactions into coherent notes.

Next, I need to implement the core features:
	1.	Markdown Editing (Middle Panel)
	2.	File Navigation (Left Panel)
	3.	AI Chat Interface with Ollama (Right Panel)
	4.	SQLite Integration for note storage and retrieval.

The goal is to package everything into a single installer for easy distribution.”
